Arch Linux packages mini-HOWTO
==============================

In any case, the Arch Linux wiki is the reference:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Creating_Packages


Source packages
---------------

Source packages are made of a PKGBUILD file (required) and some other
(optional) files such as patches or *.install files (containing
eg. post_install scripts)

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD


AUR
---

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR
https://aur.archlinux.org/

"The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a community-driven repository for
Arch users."

Source packages (in a tarball) are what is sent to the AUR.


Building "binary" packages
--------------------------

Change to a directory containing a PKGBUILD and associated files and build
with the "makepkg" command. See "man makepkg" for details. The result is
a *.pkg.tar.xz file.


Custom repository
-----------------

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Custom_local_repository#Custom_local_repository

Get a set of *.pkg.tar.xz files together in a directory and create (or update)
a repository database with the "repo-add" command. Eg:

    repo-add kozea.db.tar.gz *.pkg.tar.xz

Then serve this directory over HTTP, NFS or something and add it to
/etc/pacman.conf on machines where you want to install the packages:

    [kozea]
    Server = file:///home/arch-repository

While youâ€™re at it, you might want to uncomment ShowSize and TotalDownload
in the [options] category. See "man pacman.conf".
